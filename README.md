# JavaScript Replica CASIO MS80-A Calculator

I built this project using Vanilla JS, utilisng Adobe Animate CC to create the HTML5 canvas.

The Calculator and UI were built in Adobe Illustrator, before being imported into Animate CC. I found that a few of the affects did not import over correctly, such as a glass effect on the calculators screen, as Animate doesn't support this functionality.

The Calculator has been built to work exactly as the physical calculator does. All of the memory functions work as intended, and the calculator will error out at the same points the physical calculator does.

This was my first attempt at a large project with over 1000 lines of code, proving to be a great learning experience. The code needs refactored for readability, and i'm not 100% happy with the structure. This is a project I would like to come back to once i've gained more JavaScript experience.

The project allowed me to really go through the basics, focusing on logic and variable manipulation.
