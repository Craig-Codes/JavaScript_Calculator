JavaScript Replica CASIO MS80-A Calculator

I built this project using Vanilla JS, utilisng Adobe Animate CC to create the HTML5 canvas.

The Calculator and UI were built in Adobe Illustrator, before being imported into Animate CC. I found that a few of the affects did not import over correctly, such as a glass effect on the calculators screen, as Animate doesn't support this functionality.

The Calculator has been built to work exactly as the physical calculator does.

This was my first attempt at a project with over 1000 lines of code and proved to be a great learning experiance. The code needs refactored for readability, and i'm not 100% happy with the structure. This is a project I would like to come back to once i've gained more JavaScript experiance.
